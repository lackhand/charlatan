# Charlatan

A fork of Knave (, er, and Maze Rats) for Vance-like and other ungentlemanly wizards.

> My goals are to write some automation to make it more reasonable to run at the table, as well as to support _very slightly_ more character customization than raw Knave. This should maintain compatibility with old school content. It aims to retain the classless nature of the original.
